Just like your car needs fuel to make it run, your body needs fuel to make it go. Of course, your body doesn\'t run on gasoline - it runs on carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, found in foods like grains, fruits, beans, milk products and vegetables, are by far your body\'s favorite source of energy, yet providing your body with pep is not the only role carbs play. In this lesson, we will take a look at the functions of carbohydrates as well as what happens when you don\'t get enough carbs in your diet.

Protein is kind of like the backup generator when the primary energy source goes out. It\'s great that the body has this backup system in place, yet when proteins are used up for energy, they are no longer available to do their life-sustaining jobs, like helping with muscle contractions and maintaining muscle and other body tissues

Fats are the main source of energy for satisfactory growth and physical activity during early infancy. This energy requirement is not easily met where diets are low in fat (less than 15 percent of total calories), which partly explains the high prevalence of malnutrition in such areas.

Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients because they perform hundreds of roles in the body. There is a fine line between getting enough of these nutrients (which is healthy) and getting too much (which can end up harming you). Eating a healthy diet remains the best way to get sufficient amounts of the vitamins and minerals you need.

After you enjoy a meal, the carbohydrates from the foods you consumed are broken down into smaller units of sugar. These small units get absorbed out of your digestive tract and into your bloodstream. This blood sugar, or blood glucose, is transported through your bloodstream to supply energy to your muscles and other tissues. This is an important process; in fact, we could say that of the different functions of carbohydrates, supplying energy to the body is the main role.

Most of your body cells use the simple carbohydrate glucose for energy, but your brain is particularly in need of glucose as an energy source. So, we can add that an important function of carbs is supplying energy to the brain. If you have ever gone on a low-carb diet and felt like your brain was foggy for a few days, then you experienced just how important carbohydrates are to proper brain function.

Another function of carbohydrates is to prevent the breakdown of proteins for energy. By consuming sufficient amounts of carbohydrates in your diet, you ensure that your body can meet its energy needs, but if your intake of carbs is too low, or you are using them up too quickly, such as during intense exercise, then your body is forced to break down proteins for energy.

Protein is kind of like the backup generator when the primary energy source goes out. It\'s great that the body has this backup system in place, yet when proteins are used up for energy, they are no longer available to do their life-sustaining jobs, like helping with muscle contractions and maintaining muscle and other body tissues.

        <item><![CDATA[ The Power of Protein
It\'s easy to understand the excitement. Protein is an important component of every cell in the body. Hair and nails are mostly made of protein. Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues. You also use protein to make enzymes, hormones, and other body chemicals. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood.

Along with fat and carbohydrates, protein is a "macronutrient," meaning that the body needs relatively large amounts of it. Vitamins and minerals, which are needed in only small quantities, are called "micronutrients." But unlike fat and carbohydrates, the body does not store protein, and therefore has no reservoir to draw on when it needs a new supply. ]]></item>

Fats are the main source of energy for satisfactory growth and physical activity during early infancy. This energy requirement is not easily met where diets are low in fat (less than 15 percent of total calories), which partly explains the high prevalence of malnutrition in such areas.

Fats should also be considered in terms of their structural function during the first two years of life. They provide the fatty acids and cholesterol needed to form cell membranes in all the organs. Moreover, important organs such as the retina and the central nervous system are mainly composed of fats.

Most of the fats needed to form these tissues are essential fatty acids (EFAs) which cannot be synthesized by the organism and have to be acquired through nutrition. Mother\'s milk has a special fat composition that makes it unique for good child nutrition. It contains factors that facilitate the digestion of fats, while its chemical composition makes it more digestible and includes a balanced supply of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids.

Recent documented research on n-3 a -linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has focused on effects on growth and brain development. In 1993, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Fats and Oils in Human Nutrition stressed that infants should be breast-fed if possible and that breast-milk substitutes (infant formula) should mimic breast milk in faty acid content.

There is a relationship between consumption of fats and income level in developing countries. Fat consumption is insufficient in low-income groups, and this lower consumption of fats and oils has an adverse effect on the nutritional energy status of children and adults in these groups.

           Vitamins allow your body to grow and develop. They also play important roles in bodily functions such as metabolism, immunity and digestion. There are 13 essential vitamins, including vitamins A, C, D, E, and K and B vitamins such as riboflavin and folate. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the best way to meet your vitamin needs is to eat a balanced diet containing a variety of foods. If you can\'t meet your needs through food alone, you may require dietary supplements. Seek guidance from your doctor or dietitian before taking supplements            ]]>
